# Task 3: TLS Communication Inspection & Analysis

## 1. OpenSSL Output Summary (example.com)

Command Used:
    openssl s_client -connect example.com:443

### Output Includes:
- TLS Version: TLS 1.3
- Cipher Suite: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
- Certificate Chain:
    1. Root CA: ISRG Root X1
    2. Intermediate CA: R3
    3. Leaf Certificate: example.com

## 2. Wireshark TLS Handshake Summary

Captured TLS Handshake for https://example.com

### Key Events:
- Client Hello: Sent with supported cipher suites, extensions, and SNI.
- Server Certificate: Delivered server's certificate chain.
- Key Exchange: Encrypted key exchange using ephemeral keys.
- Finished: Secure connection established.

## 3. TLS Confidentiality and Integrity

- **Confidentiality**: Achieved using symmetric encryption (AES-GCM) after handshake.
- **Integrity**: Ensured using HMACs and AEAD cipher modes like AES-GCM.
- **Authentication**: Achieved via server certificates signed by trusted authorities.
